# IoT-based-data-Acquisition-and-Water-Management
The idea behind this project is to control the water pumps using our mobiles with the help of internet and radio waves emittied from a SIM card.
• Here, We bring an application to control our System. Also, In the absence of network, cellular network(radio waves) is used to control the system
• A percentage of 40% increase is expected in water demand over the period of next two decades
• Water is an important need of all Human Beings. With the rapid growth in population, the need to preserve water is gaining great importance.
• Many Water Management Systems using different technologies were performed in the past which very expensive. But the IOT based water management system which is relatively much cheaper, helps us conserve water by connecting the pumps, tanks,.... to our mobiles through Internet.
• In our project, we use a free IOT Cloud Platform "Blynk" to upload our data to the cloud and to control the water pump. The Blynk app uses internet to work. Incase of no internet, a GSM module is also connected to control the motor pumps.
• This project can be further developed and be deployed in our college. It helps in unnecessary wastage of water through taps, overflowing of tanks, and in many other ways also
